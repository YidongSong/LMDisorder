# Introduction
LMDisorder is a fast and accurate protein disorder predictor that employed embedding generated by unsupervised pretrained language models as features.We showed that LMDisorder essentially surpassed the single-sequence-based methods by more than 6.0% and 18.0% on AUROC in two independent test sets, respectively. Furthermore, LMDisor-der showed equivalent or even better performance than the state-of-the-art profile-based technique SPOT-Disorder2.
